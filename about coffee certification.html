      <h2>Coffee Nursery Certificate Application</h2>
      <p>The Coffee Nursery Certificate Application helps farmers easily apply for and receive official certification for their coffee nurseries. This certification ensures that their seedlings meet quality standards, increasing trust among buyers and support from government and agricultural programs.

    <div class="certification">
      <h2>Commercial Milling Licence Application</h2>
      <p>The Coffee Milling Licence Application allows farmers to apply for official approval to operate a coffee milling facility. With this licence, farmers can add value to their coffee by processing it themselves, reducing reliance on middlemen. It promotes better quality control, increases profit margins, and opens opportunities for direct market access. Licensed milling also ensures compliance with national standards, making it easier to build partnerships and grow their coffee business.</p>

    <div class="certification">
      <h2>Coffee Growers Notification to County Government and Direct Settlement System Provider Application</h2>
      <p>This application enables farmers to officially notify the county government and register with a Direct Settlement System (DSS) provider. By doing so, farmers ensure transparency in their coffee production and gain access to timely, direct payments for their produce. It strengthens accountability, helps track production data for support programs, and protects farmers from delayed or unfair payments. Registering also connects farmers to government services, financial institutions, and market opportunities, empowering them to grow their farming enterprises with confidence.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="certification">
      <h2>Pulping Station Application</h2>
      <p>The Pulping Station Application allows farmers to obtain approval to operate a coffee pulping station. This enables them to process coffee cherries at the source, improving quality and reducing post-harvest losses. With a licensed pulping station, farmers can add value to their coffee, increase earnings, and ensure compliance with environmental and quality standards. It also promotes better control over processing, helping farmers meet market demands and build a more sustainable and profitable coffee business.

<div class="certification">
      <h2>Warehouse Application</h2>
      <p>The Warehouse Application allows farmers or cooperatives to register and operate certified coffee storage facilities. A licensed warehouse helps ensure safe, secure, and quality storage of coffee beans, reducing losses from spoilage or theft. It also supports better planning and market timing, enabling farmers to store their produce and sell when prices are favorable. Additionally, certified warehouses may provide access to credit services using stored coffee as collateral, empowering farmers to invest in their operations and increase profitability.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="certification">
      <h2>Coffee Roaster Licence Application</h2>
      <p>Obtaining a coffee roaster license empowers farmers to add value to their coffee by roasting and selling it directly, increasing their income and market control. It opens opportunities for brand development, better pricing, and access to new markets. Additionally, licensed roasting ensures quality standards, building trust with buyers and consumers, and supporting sustainable business growth for farmers.</p>
      </div>
    <div class="certification">
      <h2>Grower Miller Licence Application</h2>
      <p>A grower miller license enables farmers to process their own coffee cherries into parchment or green coffee beans, adding value to their harvest. This reduces dependency on external mills, lowers processing costs, and improves control over quality. With the license, farmers can increase their profits, access better market opportunities, and enhance their bargaining power in the coffee supply chain.</p>
